I am a highly motivated and results-oriented `R&D process engineer` with over 6 years of experience in material science, semiconductor R&D, and process development. With a proven track record of successfully leading and executing complex technical projects, from design and development to implementation and optimization. In my previous role at a deep tech startup in the semiconductor industry, I played a key role in process development for `Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD)` instruments, achieving a 95% expansion in material capabilities, 25% reduction in patterning resolution and successfully commissioned the first commercial product.

I'm also an `entrepreneur`, having founded and led a successful 3D printing, modeling, and prototyping business where I established efficient operations and cultivated strong client relationships. 

My educational background includes a Master of Science in Chemistry from Carleton University, where I conducted advanced material development at the [Barry Lab](https://carleton.ca/barrylab/). Which includes precursor development (chemical synthesis), material and process development for `ALD` applications. 

Throughout my career, I've collaborated with cross-functional teams, presented research internationally, and even developed patent-pending solutions. I seek to help advance humanity towards a more sustainable future, where semiconductor and battery technology plays a pivotal role in addressing global challenges.
