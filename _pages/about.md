Building the Future of Semiconductors | 2x Founder & Process Engineer.

I’m a driven builder and 2x founder with over 7 years of experience pushing semiconductor technology forward. Currently, at [Atomic Semi](https://atomicsemi.com/) I’m helping build a small, fast sermiconductor fab for chip prototyping. As Founder and CEO of [Szimpla](https://szimpla.co/), I created cutting-edge processes and equipment for `semiconductor prototyping`. I also founded a prototyping business focused on 3D printing and design, delivering innovative solutions to clients.

My expertise spans material science, process development, and `Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD)`, with a track record of big wins. At a deep tech startup, I led `ALD` process and instrument development, expanding material capabilities by 95% and launching a commercial product.

I hold a Master of Science in Chemistry from Carleton University, where I developed advanced materials and precursors for `ALD` at the [Barry Lab](https://carleton.ca/barrylab/). My work has led to patent-pending solutions, international research talks, and collaborations.

Fueled by a mission to shape an efficient, tech-driven future through semiconductors, I’m here to innovate and connect. Let’s build something epic!
