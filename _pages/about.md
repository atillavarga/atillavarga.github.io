My name is Atilla Varga and I am a Chemistry MSc graduate from the [Barry Lab](https://carleton.ca/barrylab/) and currently work as an R&D Engineer at a deep tech startup [Atlant 3D](https://www.atlant3d.com/).

In my current position I help improve the resolution of the micronozzle used in Atlant 3D's Nanofabricator (spatial Atomic Layer Deposition (`ALD`) instrument); as well as expand the `ALD` materials and process capabilities.

My university chemistry research focused on upgrading 3D-printed architectures by `ALD`, to demonstrate both dielectric and metal deposition and infiltration in these substrates. Previously I have worked on synthesizing organometallic precursors in inert-atmosphere conditions for `ALD`.

I also am a co-founder of a 3D printing company which provides professional prototyping, 3D printing and 3D modeling services to clients.

My interests are in technologies for semiconductors and sustainable energy production and storage.
