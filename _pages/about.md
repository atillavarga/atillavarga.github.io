My name is Atilla Varga and I am a MSc graduate student in the [Barry Lab](/https://carleton.ca/barrylab/) at Carleton University.

My research focuses on upgrading 3D-printed architectures by Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD), to demonstrate both dielectric and metal deposition and infiltration in these substrates.

Put your address right below your picture.. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
