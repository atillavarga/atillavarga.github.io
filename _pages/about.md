My name is Atilla Varga and I am a MSc graduate from the [Barry Lab](https://carleton.ca/barrylab/) at Carleton University.

My chemistry research focuses on upgrading 3D-printed architectures by Atomic Layer Deposition (`ALD`), to demonstrate both dielectric and metal deposition and infiltration in these substrates. Previously I have worked on synthesizing organometallic compounds in inert-atmosphere conditions for `ALD`. I also own a 3D printing company which provides professional prototyping, 3D printing and 3D modeling services to clients. I am interested in technologies for sustainable energy production and storage as well as semiconductors used in microelectronics.
